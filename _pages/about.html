    NishCorp Technologies is redefining mobility with robotics designed by those who understand it best. Founded by Siddhant Singh, a wheelchair user and engineer, we’re building India’s first stair-climbing, restroom-ready robotic wheelchair—because independence shouldn’t have limits.

      Our Story & Vision
    </h2>

       style="font-size: clamp(0.9rem, 2.5vw, 1.2rem); line-height: 1.7;">
      NishCorp Technologies began with a deeply personal mission. Our founder, Siddhant Singh, a mechanical engineer from VJTI and a wheelchair user, grew up alongside his late brother Nishchay, who lived with muscular dystrophy. Watching Nishchay face the constant barriers of stairs, inaccessible restrooms, and dependent mobility sparked a question: what if robotics could make these obstacles disappear?
      <br><br>
      In Nishchay’s memory, Siddhant set out to build more than just a wheelchair. He envisioned a robotic mobility solution that wouldn’t need help, transfers, or compromises—a device that could climb stairs, navigate rough terrain, and dock directly to restrooms, all while staying compact and car-friendly. What started as a passion project in a small lab is now on the verge of becoming India’s first stair-climbing, restroom-accessible robotic wheelchair.
      <br><br>
      But our vision reaches beyond assistive mobility. At the heart of our wheelchair is a modular robotic base—a platform versatile enough to power delivery bots, defense rovers, and smart industrial carts. By building a system that adapts to multiple industries, we’re creating a robotics ecosystem where accessibility meets automation.
      <br><br>
      Our goal is simple but ambitious: to make mobility limitless and to build the world’s most inclusive robotics platform. We believe independence isn’t a privilege—it’s a right. Through a blend of human-first design, advanced robotics (ROS2, Jetson Nano), and a team driven by lived experience, we’re proving that technology can be both empowering and scalable.
      <br><br>
      At NishCorp, every prototype, every feature, and every idea is rooted in one belief: everyone deserves the freedom to move, live, and dream without barriers.
